                    <h3>Selling a Boat</h3>
                    <p>Over the past 20 years I've provided service to loads of clients whom wanted to sell their boat. I produced desirable results for people whom had realistic expectations and were able to communicate their needs.
                        I didn't produce desirable results for clients whom said they wanted things done right, but didn't want 
                        to spend much money. If you have unrealistic expectations and can't communicate your service needs clearly, you're just going waste the service technicians time. Wasting the service technicians time by speaking in riddles 
                        is a good way end up with an old dirty fiberglass money-pit in your backyard. Instead of pissing off all of the service techs in the area, callme, I'll tell you 
                        what you can realistically expect to accomplish with your restoration budget and how to inquire about service.

                    <h3>Buying a Boat</h3>
                    <p>I've had the pleasure of meeting loads of boat owners over the years whom instinctivally purchased a boat becasue it was too good of a deal to pass on! It needs some mechanical work and paint, but it was a good deal! 
                        At this point they've paid 3 or 4 service techs to service the vessel, detial it, make some improvements, and it just needs a little more mechanical work and paint. If this sounds like you or someone you know, call me. 
                        I'll let you know how much it's going to cost, how long it's going to take, and how many services you'll have to hire to restore the boat. Then, you can make a well-informed decision on whether to procceed investing in the vessel or not. 
                        Better yet, call me before purchasing a boat for a quick, low-cost inspection.

                    <h3>Boat Restoration</h3>
                    <p>We've all seen the success stories on Youtube. All you have to do is buy a boat, fix it up, grab a camera, and you're off to Youtube success traveling the 7 seas while your followers cheer you on! 
                        You can do this if you purchase the right vessel and proceed with the restoration in the correct sequence. The first step is diagnosing all of the problems with the vessel. An ocean-worthy vessel must be in tip-top shape 
                        because you can't make Youtube videos from Davy Jones's locker. Imagine discovering that the deck needs to be replaced after painting the boat. I've encountered boat owners in that situation many times over the years. 
                        Call me before proceeding with your restoration project for a quick, low-cost deck and hull inspection.

                    <h3>Repair Advice</h3>
                    <p>In my experience, about half of fiberglass repair technicians do high quality work and the other half don't. There's always been much more 
                        of a demand for fiberglass repair techs than there is supply. Fiberglass repair requires many skillsets, is manual labor, and involves using toxic substanes on a daily basis. Boat shops only pay fiberglass techs $15 - $25/h and 
                        charge $100/h for their work, so any fiberglass tech capable of making a google business listing can quadruple their income by quitting their job. You'll find the highest quality fiberglass repair techs working out of their home shops. 
                        Schedule an inspection to analyze your repair and point you in the direction of competent repair technicians.

                    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>There is a virtually endless supply of boat maintenance products on the market today and I've tested many of them. I've tested most types of waxes and ceramic coatings on my personal vehicles. 
                        I've used most brands of boat soaps, hull cleaners, and specialty cleaners in boat detailing. I've discussed vessel maintenance with thousands of customers over the years. I know what maintenance products 
                        and strategies are worth paying for and which ones are just hype. In my experience, there is alot more hype and marketing behind products than results. The best ways to cost-effecitvely maintain a boat 
                        haven't changed much over the past 50 years. Schedule an inspection with me to learn the most cost-effective and proven strategies for maintaining your vessel without turning it into a money pit.

                    <h3>Consulting</h3>
                    <p>I've provided service in boat yards all over the Delmarva Peninsula from Virginia to Pennsylvania and in Maryland as far as Washington DC, Annapolis, and Baltimore. I've witnessed several boat yards and marinas lose 
                        business because they don't provide services that customers demand. Several marinas have inquired with me about setting up a service business at their location. They wanted someone to service their customers and pay them rent 
                        and that's it: no support, no referrals, just their hand out asking for rent. If you want keep your slips full, you have to provide the services that customers require. You have to help a service business get started, 
                        communicate, and agree upon the details of the services. Schedule a consultation with me to help an entrepreneur start a service business at your location.
